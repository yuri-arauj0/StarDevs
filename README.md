### Improving JavaScript skills.

I had a really good time doing this project.<br>
I'm new to JS.

My developers friends have always made me afraid to work with JS because of their stories of how hard it is to work with... So I decided to give it a go.

It was a really fun project to work on.<br>
I took [Luis Antonio](https://github.com/zCHICOz)'s [free course on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/share/1044a63@98APIT0DYCSVQOb8OzW0hlOR_GygrGNChCgvLjtrH0hXFdP5y30kv2_JJIQdK82k9g==/). It helped me a lot in improving my CSS skills.

Here's his [YouTube page](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4NA0sh8n4ZNm76MsFyi2OQ), in case anybody wants to check it out.

## Contributions
This was made purely for educational purposes, but I'd appreciate if anyone could share any improvements - like responsive CSS (I struggle a lot with it).
